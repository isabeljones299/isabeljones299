# ISABEL JONES
## Techical Consultant
### Bristol 


I began training as a Software Engineer after completing an intergrated Masters in Chemistry and I am currently working as a technical consultant in Bristol. My goal for now is to improve my knowledge of cloud computing and gain more experience in the data side of things. In the future, I would love to find out ways to reduce global warming using technology. 
</br> 

Check out my repos for projects completed as part of my training, including a scrabble scorer in both Java and JavaScript, a React news application which stays up to date with news from the Guardian, plus a Twitter mock called "chitter" which uses an Atlas cluster to store "peeps" and user accounts.
</br>

An additional project I am working on outside of my SE course a game of scrabble which you can play online with against friends! :game_die: :video_game: :dart:
