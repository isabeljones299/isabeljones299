# ISABEL JONES
## Trainee Software Engineer and recent Chemistry Graduate
### Bristol üèôÔ∏è


I began training as a Software Engineer after completing an intergrated Masters in Chemistry. My goal for now is to create and deploy my own app! In the future, I would love to work on something with a dash of computational chemistry...
or Java, as am also working towards Oracle Java Associate Certification.</br> 

Check out my repos for projects completed as part of my training, including a scrabble scorer in both Java and JavaScript, a React news application which stays up to date with news from the Guardian, plus a Twitter mock called "chitter" which uses an Atlas cluster to store "peeps".
</br>

An additional project I am working on outside of my SE course a game of scrabble which you can play online with against friends! :game_die: :video_game: :dart:
